 *   - dry-run (default): reports how many workouts WOULD sync, plus a preview of
 *     the next one — no upload, no DB write.
 *   - live (requires ?live=1 AND authorization): loops the tested
 *     single-workout engine (syncOneWorkout) up to a safety cap, aggregating
 *     the per-workout results.
 *
 * A live upload fires only when BOTH the request asks for it (?live=1 / body
 * {live}) AND is authorized (h2g session cookie OR Bearer CRON_SECRET) — the
 * same gate as /api/sync-one.
