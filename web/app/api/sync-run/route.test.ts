/**
 * The dashboard's own sync buttons drive `/api/sync-one` once per workout, and
 * nothing on that path ever wrote the Sync log. The panel said "No sync runs
 * recorded yet" while workouts were plainly syncing, and a user read that as
 * proof his setup was broken (#565, reported again as #611).
 *
 * A row per workout would have been the easy fix and a bad one: the loop walks
 * the whole backlog, so the panel would fill with dozens of one-line entries.
 * Python wrote one row per pass, and this endpoint is that pass's end.
