/**
 * POST /api/sync-run  { synced, skipped, failed }
 *
 * Record one finished sync run in the dashboard's Sync log.
 *
 * The log had two writers, `/api/sync` and `/api/cron/sync`, and neither is
 * what the dashboard's own buttons use. Those drive `/api/sync-one` once per
 * workout, so nothing was ever recorded and the panel said "No sync runs
 * recorded yet" while workouts were plainly syncing. A user read that as proof
 * his setup was broken (#565, then #611).
 *
 * Why a separate endpoint rather than recording inside `/api/sync-one`: the
 * loop walks the backlog one workout at a time, so a row per workout would fill
 * the panel with dozens of one-line entries and make it useless. Python wrote
 * one row per pass over the list, and this is that pass's end.
 *
 * The totals come from the client because the client is what knows when the
 * run finished. A tab closed mid-run therefore records nothing, which is
 * honest: that run did not finish.
