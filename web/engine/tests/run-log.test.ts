/**
 * Tests for sync_log writing (#569).
 *
 * The bug: `sync_log` was created by the schema and read by the dashboard, and
 * nothing on the TypeScript path ever wrote to it, so the panel said "No sync
 * runs recorded yet" while syncs were happening. A user reasonably read that as
 * proof nothing had run (#565).
 *
 * The second property tested here matters as much as the first: this runs from
 * inside failure handling, so it must never throw.
