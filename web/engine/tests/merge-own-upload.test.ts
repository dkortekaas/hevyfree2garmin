/**
 * Merging into an activity we uploaded ourselves (#597).
 *
 * A user edits a workout in Hevy, changes a weight or adds a set, and re-syncs.
 * The match is the activity we uploaded the first time. Python pushes the
 * corrected sets into it; TypeScript refused, fell through to the start-time
 * lookup, found the same activity and did rename plus description only. The
 * title changed and the sets did not.
 *
 * The three lines that allow it are not the work. The work is the read-back.
 * Garmin can accept an `exerciseSets` PUT, answer success, and silently drop
 * the exercise names, leaving every set as "Choose an Exercise". On a watch
 * activity that is tolerable, because the watch's own data is the point and our
 * sets are an enhancement. On our OWN upload the activity exists only to carry
 * those sets, so a silent drop makes it worse than before while reporting
 * success. Ported from `_names_applied` in `merge.py:53-75`.
