/**
 * Tests for the merge orchestrator (#567).
 *
 * The bug being fixed is that every strategy behaved like `describe`, so the
 * tests that matter most are the ones proving the three strategies now differ,
 * and that a failed push restores what the watch had rather than leaving the
 * activity stripped of both its own sets and ours.
