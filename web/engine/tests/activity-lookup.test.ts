/**
 * `findActivityByStartTime` is layer two of the never-duplicate contract: it
 * answers "does Garmin already have this workout" before anything is uploaded.
 *
 * It can fail in two directions and they are not symmetric. Answering "no" when
 * Garmin does have it produces a duplicate activity, which is untidy. Answering
 * "yes" when Garmin does not means the workout never syncs at all, and nothing
 * says so. Widening the search (#594 date range, #595 ten minutes) pushes toward
 * the second, so the activity-type filter (#593) is what keeps it safe: a wider
 * net that still only catches the right species.
 *
 * Ported from `find_activity_by_start_time` in `src/hevy2garmin/garmin.py:232`.
