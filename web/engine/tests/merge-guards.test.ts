/**
 * Two guards on the `exerciseSets` PUT path.
 *
 * An `exerciseSets` PUT replaces EVERY set on the activity, which is why a
 * backup is taken first. In TypeScript that backup lived in a local variable,
 * so it covered a throw from the push and nothing else. On a serverless request
 * an ordinary timeout kills the process between the PUT landing and the
 * restore, and the user is left with whatever partial state the merge wrote and
 * no way back (#598).
 *
 * And the push retries by bisecting the exercise names, which is the right
 * thing when one exercise is at fault and the wrong thing to repeat for ever
 * against a Garmin that is refusing everything. Python stops after three
 * consecutive failures (#585). Garmin's per-IP limiting is already this
 * project's most common support problem, so the cost is real.
