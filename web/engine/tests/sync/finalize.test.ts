/**
 * Resuming remote finalization from a durable checkpoint, ported from
 * `finalize_pending` in `src/hevy2garmin/sync.py:116`.
 *
 * The step that matters is the delete. A replace uploads a named activity and
 * then removes the watch copy, so a run that dies between those two leaves the
 * user with two activities for one workout, permanently: reconcile will not
 * clean it up, and a later sync will not either because the workout is already
 * in the ledger. The only trace is a `watch_activity_id` on a pending row that
 * nothing reads.
 *
 * Both guards here exist to avoid making that worse rather than better.
