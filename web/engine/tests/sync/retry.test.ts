/**
 * Retry is the most dangerous button in the product. It uploads, and it is
 * pressed by a user looking at a workout that seems stuck.
 *
 * Two problems, ported from `cmd_retry_failed` in `cli.py:341-368`.
 *
 * It had no phase guard, so it would fire while an upload was still in flight.
 * A FIT that has reached Garmin but not yet appeared as an activity makes the
 * existing-activity lookup honestly answer "nothing there", and the retry then
 * sends a second copy.
 *
 * And it hand-rolled a minimal upload, `generateFit(workout, null)` with no
 * profile, no heart rate and no merge, where Python re-runs the whole sync. So
 * a retried workout came back quietly worse than every other one the user has.
