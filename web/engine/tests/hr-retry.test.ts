/**
 * Three heart-rate problems that are really one story: HR goes missing and
 * nobody finds out.
 *
 * #600 Garmin's daily monitoring feed lags. A workout that finished recently
 * often has no readings for its window on the first ask and does on the second,
 * so Python asks twice (`sync.py:545-557`). The grace period makes this MORE
 * likely, not less, because an unattended run reaches the workout not long
 * after its window opens.
 *
 * #612 `hr_cache` had three readers and no writer outside the demo seed, so the
 * cheapest source was always empty and the dashboard's chart never rendered on
 * a real install.
 *
 * #601 when fusion is on and the activity still went up without HR, say so.
 * Garmin recomputes calories from the embedded HR, so the user otherwise
 * reports the symptom (wrong calories, #343) rather than the cause.
