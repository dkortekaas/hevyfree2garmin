/**
 * Two differences in `lookupExercise`, ported from `mapper.py:822-868`.
 *
 * #591 Python has four resolution steps and TypeScript had three. The missing
 * one collapses a title to its alphanumeric skeleton and retries, so a name
 * differing only by punctuation, spacing or case still resolves instead of
 * landing on the Garmin activity as Unknown.
 *
 * #592 the two tables were consulted in the opposite order. Nobody is affected
 * today, the maps agree, but `TEMPLATE_TO_GARMIN` is GENERATED from
 * `HEVY_TO_GARMIN` and only regenerated on demand, so consulting it first
 * silently reverts every correction made to the name table.
