/**
 * Cross-check the whole lookup against the real Python.
 *
 * The fixture is what `hevy2garmin.mapper.lookup_exercise` actually returned
 * for 125 inputs: real table names, plus each one uppercased, re-spaced, and
 * with its hyphen swapped for an en dash, plus a few that should miss.
 * Regenerate with:
 *
 *   .venv/bin/python -c "import json; from hevy2garmin.mapper import \
 *     lookup_exercise as f; ..."
 *
 * Stronger than the hand-written cases next door: those assert what I believe
 * the rules are, this asserts agreement with the implementation being ported.
 * It is committed rather than built at test time so it runs in CI too.
