/**
 * Two upload outcomes that mean opposite things, and used to be one.
 *
 * `processing` means we do not know whether Garmin has the activity. Nothing may
 * be re-uploaded and reconciliation has to go and look.
 *
 * `failed` means Garmin refused the import outright. There is nothing on the
 * other side to find, waiting will never help, and the workout needs a person.
 *
 * Collapsing them left a definitively rejected upload sitting in `processing`
 * for ever, with reconcile searching Garmin for an activity that was never
 * created. Ported from `garmin.py:145-148` and `sync.py:635-641`.
 *
 * The rejection is NOT an HTTP status. Garmin answers 200 and puts the refusal
 * in the body, so a code-based check would miss every one of them.
