/**
 * Heart-rate fusion: give a synced workout the best HR series available.
 *
 * `hr_fusion` was offered in Settings and read by nothing on the web path, so
 * the toggle did nothing at all (#566). This is the port of `src/hevy2garmin/hr.py`.
 *
 * Why it exists: when a workout replaces a watch recording, the watch's
 * high-resolution HR is the most valuable thing on that activity, and deleting
 * the activity destroys it. So the HR is extracted and stored BEFORE anything
 * destructive happens, and a replacement that cannot secure it must not proceed.
 * That is what `HRBackupError` enforces.
 *
 * Sources, in the order they are preferred:
 *   1. the matched watch activity's own FIT, densest and activity-specific,
 *   2. a durable backup saved by an earlier run,
 *   3. the consumer's cached HR for this workout,
 *   4. Garmin's coarser daily monitoring feed.
 *
 * Hevy's own in-workout HR (AirPods via HealthKit) outranks all of them, but
 * the public Hevy API does not expose it today, so `extractHevyHr` returns an
 * empty list. It is kept as the seam so nothing else changes when that data
 * appears.
