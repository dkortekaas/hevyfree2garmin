/**
 * Merge a Hevy workout into the Garmin activity the user's watch recorded.
 *
 * This is the piece the web engine never had. It renamed the activity and wrote
 * a description, so every watch strategy behaved like `describe`, and the Merge
 * setting in Settings was wired to nothing. Two users reported that as a broken
 * tool (#495, #565), which it was.
 *
 * Ported from `attempt_merge` in `src/hevy2garmin/merge.py`. The three
 * strategies are unchanged:
 *
 *   describe  keep the watch activity, only write its description. No sets.
 *   merge     push the sets INTO the watch activity and keep it, so the watch's
 *             own metrics (HR, training effect, body battery) survive. Garmin
 *             will not display exercise NAMES on a device-recorded activity, so
 *             they read as "Unknown" while the reps and weights do land (#325).
 *   replace   upload a named activity and delete the watch copy. Real names, at
 *             the cost of the watch-only metrics.
