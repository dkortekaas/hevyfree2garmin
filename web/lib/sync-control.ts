/**
 * The "stop all syncing" switch.
 *
 * One flag, app_cache 'sync_control'.stopped, that every path which writes to
 * Garmin checks before it does: the dashboard buttons, the sync after a CSV
 * import, and the batch and cron loops.
 *
 * The check sits in syncOneWorkout, the single call every workout upload goes
 * through, so a loop that is already running stops at its next workout rather
 * than finishing its backlog. The workout in flight at that moment is allowed
 * to complete: cutting an upload off halfway is what leaves the half-finished
 * state the recovery path exists for.
 *
 * Dry runs are not blocked. They never touch Garmin, and previewing what would
 * sync is how a user decides whether to resume.
