/**
 * The intervals.icu cleanup reaching THIS app (#586, second half).
 *
 * The engine grew the hook in 0.9.0 and the package has its own tests for what
 * the hook does. What those cannot cover is whether anything here ever hands it
 * to the engine, which is the shape of bug this repo keeps producing: a
 * capability that exists, has tests, and is never called.
 *
 * So these assert the binding only. It is opt-in through two environment
 * variables, and with neither set the engine must receive nothing at all rather
 * than a function that quietly does nothing, because the engine skips the whole
 * step on undefined.
