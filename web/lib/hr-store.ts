/**
 * Where the sync engine's heart rate comes from and where its backup is kept.
 *
 * Two stores, for two different jobs:
 *
 *   `hr_cache`  the dashboard's per-workout heart rate. A cheap source that
 *               saves a Garmin call when the timeline has already been fetched.
 *
 *   `app_cache` under `hr_backup_<workout_id>`, the durable backup. This one is
 *               load-bearing: replacing a watch activity deletes it, and the
 *               watch's own heart rate is the most valuable thing on it. The
 *               engine refuses to replace anything it cannot back up here.
 *
 * The payload is the one `save_hr_backup` in `hr.py` writes, field for field,
 * so a backup taken by either implementation is readable by the other. That
 * matters because a user can run the Python pipeline and this app against one
 * database, and a backup only the writer understands is not a backup.
